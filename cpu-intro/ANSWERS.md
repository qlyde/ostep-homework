# Q&A

> 1/ Run `process-run.py` with the following flags: `-l 5:100,5:100`. What should the CPU utilization be (e.g., the percent of time the CPU is in use?) Why do you know this? Use the `-c` and `-p` flags to see if you were right.

100% since there is no I/O.

```bash
Time        PID: 0        PID: 1           CPU           IOs
  1        RUN:cpu         READY             1
  2        RUN:cpu         READY             1
  3        RUN:cpu         READY             1

> 2/ Now run with these flags: `./process-run.py -l 4:100,1:0`. These flags specify one process with 4 instructions (all to use the CPU), and one that simply issues an I/O and waits for it to be done. How long does it take to complete both processes? Use `-c` and `-p` to find out if you were right.

* Process 0: 4 CPU ticks
* Process 1: 2 CPU ticks (I/O run and done) + 5 I/O ticks
  * Default `io_length` is 5
* Total: 11

> 3/ Switch the order of the processes: `-l 1:0,4:100`. What happens now? Does switching the order matter? Why? (As always, use `-c` and `-p` to see if you were right)

Process 1 will run when Process 0 is BLOCKED.

* Time 1: Process 0 I/O run
* Time 2-5: Process 0 is BLOCKED, Process 1 is CPU busy and completes
* Time 6: Process 0 I/O tick
* Time 7: Process 0 I/O done
* Total time: 7
* CPU busy 85.7% (6 out of 7 ticks)

```bash
Time        PID: 0        PID: 1           CPU           IOs
  1         RUN:io         READY             1
  2        BLOCKED       RUN:cpu             1             1
  3        BLOCKED       RUN:cpu             1             1

  6        BLOCKED          DONE                           1
  7*   RUN:io_done          DONE             1

```

> 4/ We'll now explore some of the other flags. One important flag is `-S`, which determines how the system reacts when a process issues an I/O. With the flag set to `SWITCH_ON_END`, the system will NOT switch to another process while one is doing I/O, instead waiting until the process is completely finished. What happens when you run the following two processes (`-l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_END`), one doing I/O and the other doing CPU work?

It will become similar to `-l 4:100,1:0` in that CPU utilization will lower to 54.55% with 11 time ticks because Process 1 (`4:100`) must wait for Process 0's I/O to finish.

```bash
Time        PID: 0        PID: 1           CPU           IOs
  1         RUN:io         READY             1

> 5/ Now, run the same processes, but with the switching behaviour set to switch to another process whenever one is WAITING for I/O (`-l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_IO`). What happens now? Use `-c` and `-p` to confirm that you are right.

Same as question 3.

> 6/ One other important behaviour is what to do when an I/O completes. With `-I IO_RUN_LATER`, when an I/O completes, the process that issued it is not necessary run right away; rather, whatever was running at the time keeps running. What happens when you run this combination of processes? (`./process-run.py -l 3:0,5:100,5:100,5:100 -S SWITCH_ON_IO -c -p -I IO_RUN_LATER`) Are system resources being effectively utilized?

Process 0 runs the first I/O while process 1 completes. Then, process 2 and 3 run until completion before process 0 does the remaining 2 ios. This is not an effective use of the CPU.

```bash
Time        PID: 0        PID: 1        PID: 2        PID: 3           CPU           IOs

> 7/ Now run the same process, but with `-I IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE` set, which immediately runs the process that issued the I/O. How does this behaviour differ? Why might running a process that just completed an I/O again be a good idea?

Now, process 0 starts its second I/O before process 2 starts, allowing process 2 to keep the CPU busy while process 0 is I/O busy. Similarly, process 3 is CPU busy while process 0 is running its third I/O.

This results in 100% CPU utilization.

`IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE` might be a good idea because I/O busy processes are generally likely to issue subsequent I/O requests.

> 8/ Now run with some randomly generated processes using flags `-s 1 -l 3:50,3:50` or `-s 2 -l 3:50,3:50` or `-s 3 -l 3:50,3:50`. See if you can predict how the trace will turn out. What happens when you use the flag `-I IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE` versus that flag `-I IO_RUN_LATER`? What happens when you use the flag `-S SWITCH_ON_IO` versus `-S SWITCH_ON_END`?

`SWITCH_ON_IO` and `IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE` tend to result in the best CPU utilization.
